this is an array/cond assignment and shouldnt be here, move this to conditionals or basic 

You are given the following array representing test results from different environments:

JavaScript
const testResults = [
  { env: "staging", passed: 15, failed: 2, tags: ["api", "login"] },
  { env: "production", passed: 20, failed: 1, tags: ["api", "payment"] },
  { env: "staging", passed: 13, failed: 3, tags: ["ui", "login"] },
  { env: "dev", passed: 18, failed: 4, tags: ["api", "ui"] },
  { env: "production", passed: 22, failed: 0, tags: ["ui"] }
];
Your task:
Write a function called summarizeResults(testResults) that returns an object with the following structure:

environments:
An array of environment names, sorted alphabetically, with no duplicates.

totalPassed:
The sum of all passed test counts.

failedByEnv:
An object where the keys are environment names, and the values are the total number of failed tests for that environment.

uniqueTags:
An array of all unique tags used across all results, sorted alphabetically.
