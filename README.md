A small JavaScript project demonstrating basic JS and HTML setup.

## Description

This repository contains a minimal front-end + Node example with an `index.html`, `assignment1.js`, `assignment1.txt`, `asyncawait.js`, `callbacks.js`, `practicePromises1.js` and `promises.js` which i will populate as i learn/refresh JS basics.

JS asynchronous:

- Promises
- Callback functions
- Async/Await keywords

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended LTS(long term support) release). Verify with `node -v`..

Optional:

- A modern web browser for `index.html`
- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio Code Live Server Extension

## Usage

Option 1:

- Inside a CLI navigate to repo folder
- Run `node assignments.js` or `node index.js` commands depending on which script's functionality you wish to asses.
- Observe the result while following comments in the .js file to assess functionality

Option 2:

- replace line 11 in `index.html` with:

  ```html
  <script src="assignments.js"></script>
  ```

  or

    ```html
  <script src="index.js"></script>
